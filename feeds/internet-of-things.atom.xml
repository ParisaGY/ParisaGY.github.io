Internet of Things (IoT) is the internetworking of a variety of computing and communication devices implemented in buildings, vehicles, industrial networks, and Utilities. IoT consists of embedded physical devices that collect and exchange data using ubiquitous wireless communication. A challenge in IoT applications is to process and interpret the huge amount of data gathered by IoT devices. In conventional data science, Big data usually lives in the Cloud, however, this operation is critical for large-scale IoT deployments because of the sheer volumes of data being generated. Hence, IoT vendors such as Cisco and Intel propose Edge Analytics to process the data near the source so that sending all data to the Cloud is not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edge analytics in IoT is very challenging due to limited computational power on the edge IoT devices, e.g., Raspberry Pi. Moreover, since the edge analytics is performed in real-time as data is generated, using fast and light-weight analytical tools is a key. Ajit Jaokar from FutureText believes that edge analytics in IoT requires 1) real time tagging to distinguish between useful real data and noise since IoT data at the edge is unstructured and created from various sources; and 2) real-time data aggregation and correlation to detect emerging events and in the context of each IoT application domain.&lt;/p&gt;
