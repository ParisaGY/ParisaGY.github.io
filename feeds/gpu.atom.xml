The CPU (central processing unit) has been called the brain of computer systems. On the other hand, 
the GPU (graphics processing unit) is a specialized electronic chip produced to play as the soul of 
these systems as claimed by NVIDIA, one of the many companies that produces GPUs. GPU is designed to 
rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer 
intended for output to a display device. Thus, GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GPU-accelerated computing has recently grown into a mainstream movement supported 
by the Apple and Microsoft operating systems from and can now take on many multimedia tasks. 
The high-parallelism inherent to the GPU makes it well-suited to address computational intensive 
machine learning algorithms. For example, GPUMLib is an open source GPU machine learning library proposed to 
provide the building blocks of machine learning software. Recently, a GPU-based machine learning library on Apache Spark, 
called BIDData, is proposed by researchers in UC Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
